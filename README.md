# HCI Lab 5 – HCI Principles Demo

## Overview

This Lab demonstrates fundamental **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** principles through a simple, interactive web interface. The application showcases how users interact with systems and how the system communicates its state back to the user.

### Key Principles Showcased:

- **Visibility of system status**
- **Immediate feedback**
- **Constraints**
- **Signifiers**

The interface allows users to click a button to simulate processing an action, while dynamically updating system status and enforcing interaction limits.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction:** The user clicks the "Process Data" button.
2. **Feedback:** The button temporarily changes appearance (yellow highlight) and the status message updates with the click count.
3. **Constraint Enforcement:** After **3 clicks**, the system:

- Disables the button.
- Changes styling to indicate a restriction.
- Displays a "Limit reached" message with a red visual constraint.

## HCI Principles Demonstrated

### ✅ 1. Visibility of System Status

The `<div id="status">` element continuously informs the user of their progress. This ensures the user is never left guessing about the current state of the application.

### ✅ 2. Feedback

Every action has a reaction. Immediate feedback occurs when:

- The button turns yellow upon clicking.
- The status text updates instantly.
- The limit message appears.

### ✅ 3. Constraints

Logical constraints prevent user error by restricting actions before they can lead to an invalid state.

```javascript
if (count >= 3) {
  btn.disabled = true;
}
```

> **Goal:** Prevent further interaction after three clicks, reducing errors and enforcing system rules.

### ✅ 4. Signifiers

Visual cues communicate the "soul" of the interface:

- **Disabled styling:** Greyed out button indicates it's no longer clickable.
- **Red border:** High-contrast color indicates a limit or error state.
- **Symbols:** Using (✔, ⛔) provides instant semantic meaning.

## Expected Behavior

| Click Count | System Response                         | Visual Feedback                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **1**       | Button highlights, status updates       | Yellow Glow / Text Update       |
| **2**       | Button highlights again, status updates | Yellow Glow / Text Update       |
| **3**       | Button disables, red warning displayed  | **Red Border / Disabled State** |
| **4+**      | No action (Interaction blocked)         | Static Disabled UI              |
